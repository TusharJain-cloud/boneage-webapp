    st2.write('Bone Age Assessment through radiographs of the left hand is widely used in the diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of endocrine, genetic and growth disorders in children. Absent birth data is a big problem in our part of the world. Around 65% of all births are not registered by the age of 5 years. Thus the need for accurate estimation of age arises in conditions where the age of a child needs to be accurate, such as during immigration, in lawsuits and in competitive sports. In these cases bone age is used to provide the closest estimate of chronological age.       Bone age assessment is an essential tool in the evaluation and follow-up of GHD patients. The bone age study can help evaluate how fast or slowly a child''s skeleton is maturing, which can help doctors diagnose conditions that slow down or speed up physical growth and development. This test is usually ordered by pediatricians or pediatric endocrinologists.')
